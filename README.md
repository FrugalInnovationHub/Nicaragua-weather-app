# Nicaragua Weather Application

## About project:
ASDENIC is an organization that partners with local farmers and citizens in northern
Nicaragua to provide resources and information to ensure the safety of residents and
optimize agricultural techniques. Currently, a singular, localized weather station collects
useful information on patterns that can be used for indicators, yet the data requires
manual processing and there is not a system in place to report the findings. The current
method of information transfer is in person during weekly meetings which can be
ineffective and inconsistent.
In continuation of a previous project focused on sharing water quality
information, our mobile application acts as a platform for leaders to share valuable
weather indicators with members of the community in real time instead of on a weekly
basis. This allows community leaders to disseminate all relevant information with the
community in a reliable and easy-to-digest manner. As an additional benefit, providing
accessible information to community members reduces the need for large group
gatherings, especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.
